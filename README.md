## What is DeBank?

DeBank is a non-custodial, Decentralized savings vault built on OPN Chain. Users deposit **IOPN** (and soon USDC, USDT, and other OPN Chain assets) into a smart contract, set their own unlock date, and walk away knowing their funds are safe until they're ready.

The discipline is built in by design — your assets stay locked until maturity. An emergency exit is always available for a small fee, so you're never permanently blocked from your own money.

```

### Core Functions

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `createLock(token, amount, duration)` | Deposit and lock assets for a chosen duration |
| `topUp(lockId, amount)` | Add more to an existing lock |
| `claim(lockId)` | Withdraw a matured lock (normal fee) |
| `claim(lockId)` before unlock | Early withdrawal (higher fee) |
| `getUserLockIds(address)` | Get all lock IDs for a wallet |
| `getLock(lockId)` | Read a single lock's data |

### Fee Structure

| Action | Fee |
|---|---|
| Deposit | 0.5% |
| Withdraw at maturity | 0.5% |
| Early withdrawal | 2.0% |
| Maximum possible fee | 5.0% (hard-coded ceiling) |

## 🛡️ Security Design

- ✅ **No admin access to user funds** — owner-only functions are limited to fee settings and ERC-20 allow-list
- ✅ **Fee ceiling enforced on-chain** — cannot exceed 5% regardless of owner calls
- ✅ **Owner verified at claim time** — cross-wallet theft is impossible by contract logic
- ✅ **Reentrancy guard** — OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard` applied to all state-changing functions
- ✅ **Pause never blocks withdrawals** — users can always exit, even during a pause
- ✅ **Double-claim prevention** — claimed locks are flagged and reject further attempts


## ✅ Test Results

```
TimeLockVault
  ✔ deploys with correct initial state
  ✔ creates a lock and stores correct data
  ✔ allows the owner to top up a lock
  ✔ allows claim after unlock time (normal fee)
  ✔ allows early claim with higher fee
  ✔ rejects claim by non-owner wallet
  ✔ rejects double-claim on same lock
  ✔ rejects fees above the 5% ceiling
  ✔ blocks new locks when paused, allows claim
  ✔ rejects lock duration outside allowed range

10 passing
